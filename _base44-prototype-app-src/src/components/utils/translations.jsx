His backflips were the stuff of legend, but he had one tiny flaw: he couldn't help but make a little 'purr-thump' sound every time he landed. The judges, sticklers for rules, said that was a no-no.",
      p2: "But Pringles is a \"never-stick-your-head-too-deep-into-the-litter-box\" kind of cat. He left sports behind and found a new calling on the open ice roads—a way to support himself and, most importantly, ensure a never-ending supply of his favorite 'Party Mix' treats.",
      p3: "Life was good, full of trucking, naps, and friends. The only problem? Keeping track of it all was harder than finding a good cardboard box. So, he built this app to manage his deliveries and maximize his nap time.",
